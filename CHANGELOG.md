# Changelog

All notable changes to ApplyPilot will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Google Docs template workflow** - new `applypilot tailor-doc` command copies a
  Google Doc template, fills placeholders from a tailored resume text file, and
  exports a PDF for manual review.
- **Template renderer module** - added `src/applypilot/tools/doc_template.py` for
  parsing tailored `.txt` output and mapping to placeholders:
  `{{NAME}}`, `{{TITLE}}`, `{{CONTACT}}`, `{{PHONE}}`, `{{EMAIL}}`,
  `{{SUMMARY}}`, `{{SKILLS}}`, `{{EXPERIENCE}}`, `{{PROJECTS}}`,
  `{{SERVICE}}`, `{{EDUCATION}}`.
- **Drive/Docs helpers** - added copy, Docs text replacement, and PDF export helpers
  in `src/applypilot/google/drive.py`.
- **Provider override** - `LLM_PROVIDER` env var now supports explicit provider
  selection (`gemini`, `openai`, `local`).

### Changed
- **Standalone tailor command** - `applypilot tailor` now supports:
  - `--gdoc` to upload tailored `.txt` outputs as Google Docs
  - `--drive-folder-id` to target a specific Drive folder
- **Google OAuth defaults** - default scopes now focus on Drive + Docs for resume
  workflows; Gmail/Calendar scopes can be enabled via
  `APPLYPILOT_GOOGLE_FULL_SCOPES=1`.
- **Google credential resolution** - auth now resolves credentials from multiple
  practical paths (`GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE`, `~/.applypilot`, CWD, package config)
  and stores tokens in `~/.applypilot/google_token.json`.

### Fixed
- **LLM env timing bug** - provider detection no longer snapshots API keys at import;
  it reads environment variables at client creation time.
- **LLM "hang" behavior** - improved timeout/retry handling and network error logging
  in `llm.py` to fail faster and surface retry reasons.
- **Google Docs resume download** - `download_file()` now handles Google Docs by
  exporting to plain text instead of failing with `fileNotDownloadable`.
- **Standalone tailoring runner syntax/control flow** - fixed loop exception handling
  in `tailor_standalone.py` that could raise syntax/runtime errors.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Parallel workers for discovery/enrichment** - `applypilot run --workers N` enables
  ThreadPoolExecutor-based parallelism for Workday scraping, smart extract, and detail
  enrichment. Default is sequential (1); power users can scale up.
- **Apply utility modes** - `--gen` (generate prompt for manual debugging), `--mark-applied`,
  `--mark-failed`, `--reset-failed` flags on `applypilot apply`
- **Dry-run mode** - `applypilot apply --dry-run` fills forms without clicking Submit
- **5 new tracking columns** - `agent_id`, `last_attempted_at`, `apply_duration_ms`,
  `apply_task_id`, `verification_confidence` for better apply-stage observability
- **Manual ATS detection** - `manual_ats` list in `config/sites.yaml` skips sites with
  unsolvable CAPTCHAs (e.g. TCS iBegin)
- **Qwen3 `/no_think` optimization** - automatically saves tokens when using Qwen models
- **`config.DEFAULTS`** - centralized dict for magic numbers (`min_score`, `max_apply_attempts`,
  `poll_interval`, `apply_timeout`, `viewport`)

### Fixed
- **Config YAML not found after install** - moved `config/` into the package at
  `src/applypilot/config/` so YAML files (employers, sites, searches) ship with `pip install`
- **Search config format mismatch** - wizard wrote `searches:` key but discovery code
  expected `queries:` with tier support. Aligned wizard output and example config
- **JobSpy install isolation** - removed python-jobspy from package dependencies due to
  broken numpy==1.26.3 exact pin in jobspy metadata. Installed separately with `--no-deps`
- **Scoring batch limit** - default limit of 50 silently left jobs unscored across runs.
  Changed to no limit (scores all pending jobs in one pass)
- **Missing logging output** - added `logging.basicConfig(INFO)` so per-job progress for
  scoring, tailoring, and cover letters is visible during pipeline runs

### Changed
- **Blocked sites externalized** - moved from hardcoded sets in launcher.py to
  `config/sites.yaml` under `blocked:` key
- **Site base URLs externalized** - moved from hardcoded dict in detail.py to
  `config/sites.yaml` under `base_urls:` key
- **SSO domains externalized** - moved from hardcoded list in prompt.py to
  `config/sites.yaml` under `blocked_sso:` key
- **Prompt improvements** - screening context uses `target_role` from profile,
  salary section includes `currency_conversion_note` and dynamic hourly rate examples
- **`acquire_job()` fixed** - writes `agent_id` and `last_attempted_at` to proper columns
  instead of misusing `apply_error`
- **`profile.example.json`** - added `currency_conversion_note` and `target_role` fields
